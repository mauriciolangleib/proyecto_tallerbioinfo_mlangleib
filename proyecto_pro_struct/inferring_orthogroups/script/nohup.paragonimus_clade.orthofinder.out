Writing orthogroups to file
---------------------------
OrthoFinder assigned 44368 genes (88.6% of total) to 10580 orthogroups. Fifty percent of all genes were in orthogroups with 4 or more genes (G50 was 4) and were contained in the largest 4722 orthogroups (O50 was 4722). There were 7375 orthogroups with all species present and 5343 of these consisted entirely of single-copy genes.
